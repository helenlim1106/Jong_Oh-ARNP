    <h2>New Patients</h2>
    <p>There will be 1-2 initial visits to ensure proper assessment and thorough evaluation. I will prescribe medication on a case by case on the first visit. The first appointment(s) are 60 minutes, and subsequent appointments will range from 30-60 minutes depending on each personâ€™s needs and preferences. These appointments will be used to evaluate, educate and determine a mental health diagnosis, as well as discuss side effects and efficacy of your prescribed medication.</p>
    <h2>Follow-Up Assessments</h2>
    <p>I may want to see you weekly until either your symptoms are alleviated, or your condition is stabilizing. We will work together to determine the best frequency of appointments going forward based on your health, treatment goals and stability of your condition. For long-term clients, I need to you at least every three months in order to continue safe and effective management of your medications.</p>
    <h2>Prescriptions</h2>
    <p>I offer medication management services for individuals. I see clients 18 to 75 years old. I offer case management services on a limited case-by-case basis, which may include providing paperwork for disability, unemployment, adoption, and some legal issues. I do not offer services for individuals who are court mandated for treatment or seeking treatment in which disclosure of appointments will need to be provided to an outside entity.</p>
