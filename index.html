    <p>An Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) is more than “just a nurse.” ARNPs are elite, autonomous healthcare providers who have completed at least six years of rigorous post-secondary and graduate education. They begin their careers as registered nurses, then advance through master’s- or doctoral-level training in clinical assessment, diagnostic reasoning, and evidence-based treatment within their specialty.</p>
    <p>After this intensive coursework, ARNPs must pass a national certification exam and obtain state licensure—credentials that grant them full prescriptive authority in every U.S. state. ARNPs can independently order and interpret laboratory or imaging studies, develop and manage treatment plans, prescribe medications, and bill insurance companies just like physicians.</p>
    <h2>Meet Dr. Jong Oh, ARNP, PMHNP-BC</h2>
    <p>With more than a decade of specialized psychiatric care under his belt, Dr. Jong Oh is the kind of provider you’ll trust from your very first conversation. As a board-certified Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP-BC) holding a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) from the University of Washington, he combines clinical mastery with genuine compassion—specializing in psychiatric medication management to help you find stability and hope.</p>
    <p>Dr. Oh’s expertise spans the full adult lifespan—from young professionals wrestling with anxiety or ADHD to older adults navigating mood disorders or trauma recovery. He’s equally at home in inpatient and outpatient settings, so whether you’re facing complex, severe symptoms or seeking focused, collaborative support, you’ll benefit from his holistic, evidence-based approach.</p>
